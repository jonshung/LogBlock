  <h3 align=center> üìñ LogBlock: the developer-centric social media platform  </h3>
  LogBlock is designed to provide a better design and information flows for a platform where code sharing is easier than ever!

  </br>

<i>Currently, this project only consists of engineering design and implementation is not completed. However, everyone is free to submit changes if felt suited :).</i>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## üìú Prerequisites

- Docker (preferably the latest version).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

<h3 align=center> üñáÔ∏è Components linking </h3>

In order for the three main components of a LogBlock unit to work, they must know where to look for the required depending processes.
</br>

Each component's hostname and port can be customized in the docker compose `compose.yaml` file. Mount source for database storage can be changed via the `volume` section, under the `db-data` unit. It is advised that the location has already existed before Docker is run. Mount destination is best to keep to default.
</br>

> <i>Be careful, since this is only an early stage implementation of the project, certain security aspect (such as setting environment variables directly in a docker compose file) can strictly weaken the system and should not be used in production.</i>

<h3 align=center> üåë Back-end customization and linking </h3>

Individual components must also know where their dependencies are using environment variables. Automatic bindpoint generation is not supported at the moment.
</br>

Back-end component can be switch to `development` mode by setting `development` in the `BUILD_TYPE` field. `development` mode allows developers to profile dependencies injection order and monitor for extensive Spring-related errors.
</br>

At `src/back-end/.env`, the current necessary credentials matching those that were set in the `compose.yml` file are listed. Oauth authentication can only be supported once both `OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` is set.

<h3 align=center> ‚òÄÔ∏è front-end customization and linking </h3>

Similarly, component linking must also be set in the `front-end`'s environment variables. The variable `ENABLE_AUTH_GUARD` can be used to enable Oauth authentication on the front-end. `back-end` requires an authentication token retrieved through the `SESSION_TOKEN` cookie, which can also be disabled by starting the `back-end` in `development` mode.

## üì¶ Building

The project can simply be built using the provided compose file:
```console
$ docker compose up --build --force-recreate
```
Which will always rebuild the component images and start the components. If that is not desired, remove the `--force-recreate` flag.
</br>

The created images are as minimal as possible, and dependencies are only needed during build stage, which are destroyed after the system is fired up.

## üñºÔ∏è Usage

The project can easily be fired up through the same docker compose file used during the initiation process.

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## üéâ Contributing

Since this is a academic project resource, I do not anticipate additional contribution to the repo. But if you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. I'll try to allocate time to review and push the changes as soon as possible.
